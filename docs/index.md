# Welcome to e-Infra CZ Documentation!

The home for documentation of all e-Infra CZ services that are provided to scientific community in the Czech Republic.

[e-INFRA CZ]( https://du.cesnet.cz/en/start) is a research and development e-infrastructure in the Czech Republic,
which provides capacities and resources for the transmission, storage, and processing of scientific and research data.

<!--The project, realized between 01/2020 and 12/2022, was declared by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports
in accordance with the Road Map of the Czech Republic for Large Infrastructures for Research, Experimental Development and Innovations.-->
<!-- Fakt nase uzivatele zajima nejake MSMT? Anebo tam tenhle odstavec MUSI byt z politickych duvodu? Pokud nemusi, z uzivatelskeho hlediska je to slovni vata, pryc s tim.-->
