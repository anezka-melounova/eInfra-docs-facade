# Welcome to e-Infra CZ Documentation!

The home for documentation of all e-Infra CZ services that are provided to scientific community in the Czech Republic.

[e-INFRA CZ]( https://du.cesnet.cz/en/start) is a unique research and development e-infrastructure in the Czech Republic,
which provides capacities and resources for the transmission, storage, and processing of scientific and research data.

The project, realized between 01/2020 and 12/2022, was declared by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports
in accordance with the Road Map of the Czech Republic for Large Infrastructures for Research, Experimental Development and Innovations.

e-INFRA CZ interconnects all three national e-infrastructures in the Czech Republic â€“ [CESNET](https://www.cesnet.cz/?lang=en), [CERIT-SC](https://www.cerit-sc.cz/), and [IT4Innovations](https://www.it4i.cz/en).
